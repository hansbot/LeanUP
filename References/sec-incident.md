# Types of Security Incidents

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.cynet.com/incident-response/) describes eight types of security incidents potentially necessitating a security incident response.

| # | Type | Description | Example |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Unauthorized access attempts | Perpetrators or groups attempt to breach an organization's systems or data by using various methods such as hacking, brute force attacks, or social engineering. | A hacker tries multiple password combinations to gain unauthorized entry into a company's database. |
| 2 | Privilege escalation | Attackers take advantage of system vulnerabilities or stolen credentials to elevate their access rights. | Exploiting a software bug to gain administrator-level privileges on a network. |
| 3 | Insider threat | Current or former insiders misuse their authorized access to the organization's systems for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive data or disrupting operations. | An employee with access to critical systems intentionally leaks sensitive customer information. |
| 4 | Phishing | Deceptive emails or messages trick recipients into disclosing confidential information or downloading malware. | Employees receive fake emails disguised as official communication, leading them to unknowingly reveal login credentials. |
| 5 | Malware intrusion | Viruses or Trojan horses infiltrate systems, allowing malicious activities like data theft or encryption of files for ransom. | Opening an email attachment that contains a virus, leading to the encryption of company files. |
| 6 | Denial-of-service (DoS) | A system or network is flooded with excessive traffic to disrupt legitimate users' access to resources or services. |  Overloading a website with a flood of automated requests, making it inaccessible to legitimate users. |
| 7 | Man-in-the-middle (MitM) | Attackers intercept and alter communications between two parties to steal data or inject malicious content. | Intercepting unencrypted Wi-Fi signals to eavesdrop on data transmissions between a user and a website. |
| 8 | Advanced persistent threat (APT) | Bad actors conduct coordinated and stealthy attacks with long-term objectives to persistently breach systems, steal data, or maintain unauthorized access. | Infiltrating a company's network with custom malware to continuously extract sensitive information over an extended period. |
