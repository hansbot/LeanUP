The [LeanUP](/Overview/leanup.md) recognizes 5 key milestones. A milestone marks the start and/or endpoint of a stage. Endpoint milestones are triggers for a go-nogo decision. Remember, failing early in the product development cycle drives your waste down. Besides, it opens up resources to chase [value opportunities](/Artefacts/val-oppo.md) than might have gone to waste otherwise. 

| # | Milestone | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [Value Opportunity](/Artefacts/val-oppo.md) | In any enterprise, there are many ideas to develop the Value. They may be entirely original or copied, based on market demand or envisioning blue oceans, it may be a simple improvement or modernization. It only becomes a Value opportunity at the point that someone decides to start investing resources in exploring the idea. This may be a formal decision or an informal assignment, or even an internship |
| 2 | [Value Case](/Artefacts/val-case.md) |  |
| 3 | [Development Case](/Artefacts/dev-case.md) | |
| 4 | [Prototype Review](/Artefacts/pro-review.md) | |
| 5 | Initial Release | The Initial Release is not the end of a stage, but the start of the value form your development efforts streaming into your organization. It is generally time to celebrate your achievements, look back at the bumpy road, take lessons, and look forward to the future potential |
