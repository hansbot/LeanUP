A [Value Opportunity][oppo] is typically defined as a research assignment to explore the Value potential. The opportunity may be anything from a high-risk venture to a no-brainer. It might take months or just require a single phone call.
It is easily defined as a Research Story.

## Example Research Story

```text
As a podcast manager
I want to explore the potential for a podcast promotion channel
So that we can optimize the search engine results...
and thereby increase our audience...
and thereby our reputation...
and thereby our revenu
```

It is highly recommended to define a research story with a well defined goal. This focuses the discussion and helps to define the objectives in a value case.

## Definition of Done

A typical definition of done describes the kind of output that is expected. In the [LeanUP](/Overview/leanup.md), a [Value Case][valcase] is required to enter the next stage.

## Conditions

There may be a number of conditions, including progress reporting, time and resource limits.

## Research Questions

It is always recommended to specify the research questions that should be discussed during the [Discovery Stage][discovery]
It is also recommended to exclude questions that are a distraction for this case. After all, when the initiative fails at this stage, the waste should be minimized.

The [Value Case][valcase] artefact has a list of typical questions to consider.
