A [Business Opportunity][oppo] is typically defined as a research assignment to explore the business potential. The opportunity may be anything from a high-risk venture to a no-brainer. It might take months or just require a single phone call. 
It is easily defined as a Research Story.

## Example Research Story

```
As a podcast manager
I want to explore the potential for a podcast promotion channel
So that we can optimize the search engine results and thereby increase our audience*
```

## Definition of Done
A typical definition of done describes the kind of output that is expected. In the [Lean Unified Process](/Overview/lup.md), a [Business Case][buscase] is required to enter the next stage.

## Conditions
There may be a number of conditions, including progress reporting, time and resource limits. 

## Research Questions
It is always recommended to specify the research questions that should be discussed during the [Inception Stage][inception]
It is also recommended to exclude questions that are a distraction for this case. After all, when the initiative fails at this stage, the waste should be minimized.

The [Business Case][buscase] artefact has a list of typical questions to consider.
