The Lean Unified Process is supposed to be, well, *L E A N*. Therefore, you'll be fruitlessly looking for extensive document templates. Instead, there's just some hints of the questions you want your deliverable to answer. If it's done on a whiteboard, in a presentation, on a wiki, a podcast or a document does not really matter. 

Every organization has it's own way of working. Although I prefer to keep it as Lean as possible, I've also experienced formal modeling can be a great tool to think things through. I recommend to produce just a few formal deliverables, ones you can reasonably keep up to date. Everything else is a working artefact that should be discarded once it's served its purpose. Needless to say that working artefacts are ideal candidates to quickly draft and discuss.
