The Lean Unified Process is supposed to be, well, *L E A N*. Therefore, you'll be fruitlessly looking for extensive document templates. Instead, there's just some imporant hints of the questions you want your deliverable to answer. If it's done on a whiteboard, in a presentation, on a wiki, a podcast or a document mostly does not matter. 

Every organization has it's own way of working. Although I prefer to keep it as Lean as possible, I've also experienced formal modeling can be a great tool to think things through. I recommend to produce just a few formal deliverables, ones you can reasonably keep up to date. Everything else is a working artefact that should be discarded once it's served its purpose. Needless to say that working artefacts are ideal candidates to just quickly draft and discuss. 

1. Here's the outline for a [Value Opportunity](/Artefacts/val-oppo.md) artefact
2. Here's the outline for a [Value Case](/Artefacts/val-case.md) artefact
2. Here's the outline for a [Development Case](/Artefacts/dev-case.md) artefact
3. Here's the outline for a [Prototype](/Artefacts/pro-review.md) review artefact
4. Here's the outline for an [API release review](/Artefacts/rel-review) artefact
5. Here's the outline for an [API security plan](/Artefacts/sec-plan) artefact
