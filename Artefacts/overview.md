The Lean Unified Process is supposed to be, well, *L E A N*. Therefore, you'll be fruitlessly looking for extensive document templates. Instead, there's just some imporant hints of the questions you want your deliverable to answer. If it's done on a whiteboard, in a presentation, on a wiki, a podcast or a document mostly does not matter.

Every organization has it's own way of working. Although I prefer to keep it as Lean as possible, I've also experienced formal modeling can be a great tool to think things through. I recommend to produce just a few formal deliverables, ones you can reasonably keep up to date. Everything else is a working artefact that should be discarded once it's served its purpose. Needless to say that working artefacts are ideal candidates to just quickly draft and discuss.

This is a set of key artefacts to consider. In the [Capabilities](/Capabilities/overview.md) section, you'll find the contribution of a capabilty throughout the [Stages](/Stages/overview.md).

1. Here's the outline for an [Architecture Plan](/Artefacts/arch-plan) artefact
2. Here's the outline for an [Information Security Plan](/Artefacts/sec-plan) artefact
3. Here's the outline for a [Value Opportunity](/Artefacts/val-oppo.md) artefact
4. Here's the outline for a [Value Case](/Artefacts/val-case.md) artefact
5. Here's the outline for a [API Design](/Artefacts/api-design.md) artefact
6. Here's the outline for a [Development Case](/Artefacts/dev-case.md) artefact
7. Here's the outline for an [Release Plan](/Artefacts/rel-plan) artefact
8. Here's the outline for a [API Prototype](/Artefacts/pro-review.md) review artefact
9. Here's the outline for an [API Release](/Artefacts/rel-review) review artefact
10. Here's the outline for a [Risk List](/Artefacts/risklist.md) artefact
11. Here's the outline for a [Daily Compliance](/Artefacts/dailyCompliance.md) report
12. Here's the outline for a [Monthly Compliance](/Artefacts/monthlyCompliance.md) report
13. Here's the outline for a [Post Mortem](/Artefacts/post-mortem.md) report
