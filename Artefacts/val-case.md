A [Value Case](/Artefacts/val-case.md) artefact has the specification of the Value value and costs for the proposed product development.

## Questions to Answer

Every [Value Opportunity][oppo] is different. Hence, the questions that the Product Researcher must answer might vary. It is always a good idea to define specific questions at the start of the [Discovery Stage][discovery] in the [Value Opportunity][oppo].

This is a list of typical questions that are discussed during the [Discovery Stage][discovery]

1. What is the value/market opportunity or potential improvement
2. What are the drivers for change?
3. Who is our target audience?
4. What value are we creating for them?
5. What capabilities do we need?
6. Who are the main stakeholders?
7. What are their main concerns
8. Do we have sufficient buy-in for the required budget?
9. How do we measure success?
10. Are we competitive?

Usually, the answers have a significant degree of uncertainty. Timing is often a big unknown â€“ the time to market as well as the market dynamics at that time. Therefore, risks must be actively managed. A risk list is a tool to keep an eye on driving risks down, and to initiate swift action once risks have become unacceptable.

## Objectives

An objective adds a quantification to a goal. A goal can have multiple objectives, and an objective can serve multiple goals. Having a discrete set of objectives helps to measure future success. When circumstances change, reconsidering the objectives is a first step in reprioritizing the initiative.

## Relation to other Artefacts

The [Information Security Plan](/Artefacts/sec-plan) defines a standard list of information security risks to consider
