A [Development Case](/Artefacts/dev-case.md) artefact has the specification of the business value and costs for the proposed product development.

## Questions to Answer
Every [Business Opportunity][oppo] is different. Hence, the questions that the Product Architect must answer might vary. 

This is a list of typical questions that are discussed during the [Exploration Stage][expl]
1. What API(s) do we design for which audience? In what order?
2. How are we going to engage them?
3. What platform are we targeting?
4. What API Style(s) are we providing?
5. What are the interaction cases / events?
6. What information is flowing?
7. What are typical error conditions?
8. What standards do we comply to?
9. How to prove compliance?
10. Whoâ€™s contributing what?

Usually, the answers have a certain degree of uncertainty. A proof-of-concept may serve to drive down the risks to the feasibility of the product. It may also serve to more reliably plan the elaboration stage.
