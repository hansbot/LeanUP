API Product Management is a competence that drives value creation, much like the product manager and the product owner in Agile methods are doing. The Roadmap Planning process typically sets the pace for the stage changes by creating deadlines for program increments. API Product Management works with the API Product Team to manage dependencies and meet those deadlines.

## Core Responsibilities

- Driving value creation
