Without Digital engineering, there would be no digital product. Typically, teams are separated into a platform engineering or site reliability engineering teams and digital solution teams, including front-end engineering and back-end engineering.

## Core Responsibilities

- Platform Development
- Platform Provisioning
- API Development
- API Delivery Pipeline

## Core Engineering Practices

Especially when you're targeting a cloud-based target architecture, practising DevOps, and shifting quality and security left, there are a lot of competencies required for the [Engineering Capability](/Capabilities/engineering.md). Things like

- Software development
- System integration
- Hardening
- Testing & quality control
- Ci/cd
- Packaging
- Defining desired state
- Configuration management
- Observability

[LeanUP][leanup] is not opinionated on how you practice digital engineering. There are ample mature methods to suit your particular needs. It is just a matter of fitting yours into the overarching [LeanUP][leanup] framework.
