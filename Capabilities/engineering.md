## Core Engineering Practices
Especially when you're targeting a cloud-based target architecture, practising DevOps, and shifting quality and security left, there are a lot of competencies required for the [Engineering Capability](/Capabilities/engineering.md). Things like  
- software development 
- system integration
- testing & quality control
- ci/cd
- packaging
- configuration management
- observability
[LeanUP][leanup] is not opinionated on how you practice software engineering. There are ample mature methods to choose from. That is, as long as you can fit it into the overarching [LeanUP][leanup] framework.
