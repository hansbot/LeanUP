## API Design Process
API Design is the core of the LeanUP. After all, having the right APIs at the levels at the right quality not only gives you control over your entire digital product lifecycle, it also empowers your digital value chain. 

API Design must be firmly rooted in the overal Architecture. At the same time, API Design is an excellent opportunity to update the overal Architecture to fit changing needs, or put newer technologies to good use.

In the [ADDR process model](/References/addr.md), API Design is a 4-stage process, which maps nicely on [LeanUP](/Overview/leanup.md).
