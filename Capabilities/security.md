## Core Responsibilities
- Risk Assessment
- Security Controls 
- Compliance
- Security checking and reporting

## Security Process
A typical security process is a pdca-like continuous improvement cycle. The 4 phases [LeanUP](/Overview/leanup.md) distinguishes are Prevention, Detection, Respons, and Improvement.

| Phase | Activity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Prevent | Assessing Risks, Defining Controls and Implementing Security Measures is mainly done in the early stages of the LeanUP process. Obviously, the focus is on API Security. This includes, by the way, the security of APIs the Digital Product is only consuming. |
| 2. | Detect | When you have proper monitoring in place, much of the detection and counter-measures can, and probably should be automated. Nevertheless, it is important to check at least daily if the automated detection is working as expected. Unknown threats may occur at any point in time. Submitting daily and monthly compliance reports is a proven method to build a security routine. |
| 3. | Respond | Having an Incident Respons Plan is one thing, Frequently testing and updating is yet another. The Respons Plan should at least address how to Minimize Loss & Damage, how to Collect and Secure Evidence, how to Safely Recover your Service, how to Communicate Progress and how to Perform a Post Mortem. For inspiration, have a look at this [NIST Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf). |
