# From API First to the Lean Unified Process

I am far from the first to notice that the monikers “API First”, and “API-Design First” are a bit of a misnomer. Even API-Specification First is off. If you think of the entire development process, it starts way earlier than with the ‘Design’. Rather, it starts with an idea or an opportunity. In a health organization, there are many opportunities, of which only some come to fruition. There’s a business development funnel, much like the better known sales funnel. 

James Higginbotham has become famous for outlining the ADDR-process for API-Design First. I fully understand why his proposed method fell on fertile ground. It simply gave word to the experience many of us, API designers, shared. His phases – align, define, design and refine – instantly reminded me of the Unified Process’s – inception, elaboration, construction, transition. The Unified Process was theoretically well underpinned. Everything meaningful we construct, be it an airplane, a bridge, or a nuclear power plant, roughly follows the same process journey. Why would software development be different?

I know, we’re supposed to be agile, nowadays. We don’t want to make a big design upfront. But there’s also no denying that the agile software construction typically starts halfway the entire development process. There are already domains defined, teams formed, budgets allocated and accountabilities established. You get the picture. And APIs, by there very nature, transcend a single agile team. API design is, as James Higginbotham has rightly pointed out, a very much incremental process. You need increments with clearly defined milestones for joint decision making and overall process control. 

Unfortunately, the Rational Unified Process you may remember, suffered from too many ill understood roles and from too many deliverables that brought little business value. On top of that, the people who got assigned to these roles were typically disjoint from the latest software technologies. You probably know what I mean. So, the process got the blame of failed execution. 

I believe it is time to reinvent the Unified Process, to tune it to the needs of today. I believe API design is a core piece of the new Unified Process. In the spirit of API First, getting control over interface design pretty much gives you leverage over the entire development process. API Design First yields clear bounded contexts, promoting composable software that is easy to maintain.

That’s why I am proposing the [Lean Unified Process](/Overview/lup.md).
