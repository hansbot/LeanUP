## Ownership

- Accountable : Product Development Executive / Product Manager / Product Owner
- Responsible : Product Architect

## Objective

- Establishing the feasibility of the [Value Opportunity][oppo]
- Creating alignment among Stakeholders
- Creating an initial [Development Case][devcase]

## Input

- [Value Opportunity][oppo]

## Methods

- ATAM Workshop.<br>The [Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method](/LeanUP/References/ATAM.pdf) was first published by the Software Engineering Institute of the Carnegie Mellon University. It is well-known for its proven, methodical approach to create alignment among, and commitment from the stakeholders for the high-level design decisions taken.
- Value Stream Mapping.<br>Value-stream mapping (VSM) is a fundamental lean practice that involves diagraming a value stream, which includes all the actions (value-creating and nonvalue-creating)  needed to move a product or service from raw material to the arms of the customer, including the material and information flow. Lean practitioners use the process and the resulting map to identify and eliminate waste.<br>![Example Value Stream Map](/LeanUP/Images/value-stream.png)
- Event-storming Workshop<br>Event Storming is a technique from Domain-Driven Design, to help demarcate the solution domains.

## Outcome

- The [Value Case][case] is refined and its viability has been established
- If viable, then
  - the initial [Development Case][devcase] has been accepted
  - the [Product Risk List](/LeanUP/Artefacts/risklist.md) has been updated

## Delivery Risk Reduction

During Discovery, the focus is on ensuring that the product is technically feasible given the assigned resources. A proof of concept may be required to establish the feasibility.  

## Decision

Based on the findings, the Product Architect makes a recommendation to the Product Accountable. The Product Accountable decides whether to release the budget for the next phase, and to assign the required resources.
