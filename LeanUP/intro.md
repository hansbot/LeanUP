# From API First to LeanUP – A Plea

## Motivation

I am far from the first to notice that the monikers “API First”, and “API-Design First” are a bit of a misnomer. Even API-Specification First is off. If you think of the entire development process, it starts way earlier than with its ‘Design’. Rather, it starts with an idea or an opportunity. In any healthy organization, there are many value opportunities, of which only some come to fruition. There’s a digital product development funnel, much like the better known sales funnel. We should recognize that common practice in our development approach for our APIs too.

## Inspiration

James Higginbotham has become famous for outlining the ADDR-process for API-Design First. I fully understand why his proposed method fell on fertile ground. It simply gave word to the experience many of us, API designers, shared. His phases – align, define, design and refine – instantly reminded me of the [Unified Process][up]’s stages – inception, elaboration, construction, transition. The Unified Process was theoretically well underpinned. Everything meaningful we construct, be it an airplane, a bridge, or a nuclear power plant, roughly follows the same process journey. Why would software development be different?

## Further Considerations

I know, we’re supposed to be agile, nowadays. We don’t want to make a big design upfront. But there’s also no denying that the agile software construction typically starts halfway the entire development process. There are already domains defined, teams formed, budgets allocated and accountabilities established. You get the picture. And APIs, by there very nature, transcend a single agile team. API design is, as James Higginbotham has rightly pointed out, a very much incremental process. You need increments with clearly defined milestones for joint decision making and overall process control.

Unfortunately, the Rational Unified Process you may remember, suffered from too many ill understood roles and from too many deliverables that brought little business value. On top of that, the people who got assigned to these roles were typically disjoint from the latest software technologies. You probably know what I mean. So, the process got the blame of wasteful execution. And organizations moved on to adopting 'Agile' instead.

After years of struggling to invent a *Scaling Agile* practice, the *waste* in digital development is far from *cut*. I keep coming across one of two things. Either there is a straightjacket, where features are minimized and innovation is thwarted. Or there is a complete lack of formality, leading to a complex state of unnecessary heterogeneity. Multi-clouds, private clouds, cloud agnostic platforms, there's so much to rationalize. Without a streamlined product development process, chances are that every team travels its own discovery journey, instead of creating real business value. All while introducing a massive maintenance and security burden.

## My Proposal

I believe it is time to reinvent the [Unified Process][up], and to tune it to the needs of today #LeanUP. I believe API design must become a core piece of the new [Unified Process][up]. In the spirit of API-Design First, getting control over interface design pretty much gives you leverage over the entire development process. API-Design First yields clear bounded contexts, promoting composable software that is easy to maintain. Moreover, it provides full integration agility.

More modern practices are helping to drive down product developement risks earlier in the process. Shift Left comes to mind. The Cloud-native computing principles too. And, of course, there's the widespread availability of APIs you can instantly compose into your product.

That’s why I am proposing the Lean Unified Process, or [LeanUP][leanup] for short.

Here's the [LeanUP][leanup] Product Positioning Statement.

| | |
| - | - |
| **For** | Any Digital Organization |
| **Who** | Practices Agile Digital Product Development |
| **LeanUP** | Is a useful guide |
| **That** | Merges LEAN principles with the Unified Process |
| **Unlike** | Either the Rational Unified Process or Scaling Agile initiatives |
| **Our Product** | Brings a risk-driven, integration-agile, well-governed approach to LEAN/Agile digital product development, while driving the Waste out of the Unified Process |
