```

API Product Management is a competence that drives value creation, much like the product manager and the product owner in Agile methods are doing. The Roadmap Planning process typically sets the pace for the stage changes by creating deadlines for program increments. API Product Management works with the API Product Team to manage dependencies and meet set deadlines. API Product Management also works with Stakeholders to manage their expectations, understand their concerns, and to ingest their needs in the product development process.

Since LeanUP has no separate competence for the skillset a scrum master brings to an agile process, it is the responsibility of Product Management to facilitate the implementation process and optimize the velocity of the team.
