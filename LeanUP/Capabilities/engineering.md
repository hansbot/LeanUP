Without [Digital Engineering][self], there would be no digital product. Typically, teams are separated into a platform engineering or site reliability engineering teams and digital solution teams, including front-end engineering and back-end engineering or system integration.

With the popularity of shifting left, digital engineers not only responsible for working code, including an optimized data model, but also for the quality of their code, for the security of their code, for east-west integration, for building and delivering the digital assets, and for defining the desired state of their digital products. Obviously, engineering is teamwork, so not every individual engineer needs to be proficient in every discipline.

## Core Responsibilities

- Platform Development
- Platform Provisioning
- API Development
- API Delivery Pipeline

## Core Engineering Practices

Especially when you're targeting a cloud-based target architecture, practising DevOps, and shifting quality and security left, there are a lot of competencies required for the [Engineering Capability](/LeanUP/Capabilities/engineering.md). Things like

- Software development
- System integration
- Hardening
- Testing & quality control
- Ci/cd
- Packaging
- Defining desired state
- Configuration management
- Observability

[LeanUP][leanup] is not opinionated on how you practice digital engineering. There are ample mature methods to suit your particular needs. It is just a matter of fitting yours into the overarching [LeanUP][leanup] framework.
