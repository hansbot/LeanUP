[Governance][self] forms the linking pin between general management and product management. It is bidirectional in nature, creating conditions and setting rules and guidelines on the one hand, and harvesting from practice on the other.

Much of the [Governance][self] responsibitities is about creating the conditions for an organization to survive and thrive. Thereby, it is conditional for Product Development. In the context of the LeanUP process, Governance is about **Shaping**, **Guiding** and **Guarding** Product Development.
