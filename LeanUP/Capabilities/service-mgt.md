Service Management is a competence that assures services are delivered conform service level agreements and/or service level expectations. This includes the experience developers using APIs and Platform perceive, interactions with API consumers, self-healing and pro-active notification of service degradations.

## Core Responsibilities

- Service Delivery
- API Management
- Developer Engagement
- Test & Quality Control
- API Monitoring
- Identity and Access Management

## Service Delivery Process

The Service Delivery Process is heavily dependent of the kind of client engagement model is in place. However, basic service delivery is always needed. Sometimes, there's a service integration process on top.

The main LeanUP deliverable is the [API Client Kit](/Artefacts/client-kit.md). This document defines the recurring artefacts Service Delivery produces during the lifetime of the API.
