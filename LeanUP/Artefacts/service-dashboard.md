A Service Management Dashboard typically includes insightful diagrams overviewing topics such as

* Health and Performance Monitoring
* Error handling
* Alert management
* Issue tracking
* API Analytics

Although service management reports are nowadays provided through an on-line interface, monthly reporting is often still a formal affair. Therefore, exporting a report for a given time period is basic functionality.

An advanced dashboard tracks the service level objectives, e.g. a performance target (98 percent responses in less than 500ms) and an availability target (less than 1 hour unavailability per week, less than 24 hours per year).
