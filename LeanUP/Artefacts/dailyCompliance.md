The Daily Compliance Check is an important routine to validate a range of conditions. It gets derived from the security controls that are defined. Although we are increasingly successful in automating the bulk of the checks, the importance of the daily routine has not changed. After all, you can only automate what you expect to go wrong, so it makes sense to keep looking for unexpected security events, or for regular events that are unexpectedly missing.

Some useful hints.

1. Check if all your systems are running healthily.
2. Check if all alerts have been followed-up properly.
3. Check for unusual log patterns.
4. Check for freshly released advisories.
5. Check for freshly released security patches.
6. Check backup success.
7. Check your storage space.

Don't forget the update of your daily compliance check as an potential outcome of your continuous improvement. Also, the deployment of a major change may trigger the reconsideration of your daily routine.
