An intial [Value Case][self] artefact is a milestone document, marking the end of the [Exploration Stage](/LeanUP/Stages/exploration.md) and the beginning of the [Discovery Stage](/LeanUP/Stages/discovery.md). It has a first estimation of the value and costs for the proposed product development. It helps decide the right things to develop.

## Questions to Answer

Every [Value Opportunity][oppo] is different. Hence, the questions that the Product Researcher must answer might vary. It is always a good idea to define specific questions at the start of the [Discovery Stage][discovery] in the [Value Opportunity][oppo].

This is a list of typical questions that are discussed during the [Discovery Stage][discovery]

1. What is the value/market opportunity or potential improvement
2. What are the drivers for change?
3. Who is our target audience?
4. What value are we creating for them?
5. What capabilities do we need?
6. Who are the main stakeholders?
7. What are their main concerns
8. Do we have sufficient buy-in for the required budget?
9. How do we measure success?
10. Are we competitive?

Usually, the answers have a significant degree of uncertainty. Timing is often a big unknown â€“ the time to market as well as the market dynamics at that time. Therefore, risks must be actively managed. A risk list is a tool to keep an eye on driving risks down, and to initiate swift action once risks have become unacceptable.

## Objectives

An objective adds a quantification to a goal. A goal can have multiple objectives, and an objective can serve multiple goals. Having a discrete set of objectives helps to measure future success. When circumstances change, reconsidering the objectives is a first step in reprioritizing the initiative.

## Viability

A [Value Case][self] established the viability of the [Value Opportunity][oppo], by assessing

- the economics of the case<br>This includes metrics like the opportunity cost estimation, the estimated market potential, the savings potential, and the estimated costs of delay
- the availability of the digital technology<br>Building upon existing digital assets is less risky, has a shorter time to market, and is easier to deliver. Alternatively, assess the risks, timelines and dependencies of closing the gap
- other investment costs<br>Think of training, marketing, sales, and development of the support systems and services
- demand for resources in relation to its potential supply<br>Necessary resources may range from office space to critical subject matter experts

## Relation to other Artefacts

The [Information Security Plan](/LeanUP/Artefacts/sec-plan) defines a standard list of information security risks to consider
